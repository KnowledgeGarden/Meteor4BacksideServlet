# Meteor4BacksideServlet #
A basic shell project for communicating with BacksideServletKS found here https://github.com/KnowledgeGarden/BacksideServletKS

Meteor has its own internal protocol, DDP.<br/>
BacksideServlet has its own unnamed (eventually to be blended with some REST standard) protocol.<br/>
Meteor4BacksideServlet seeks to blend both protocols.In this case, two Meteor collections are used, but not in the way a more traditional Meteor app uses them; they serve simply to make resources fetched from BacksideServlet reactive, but not persistent locally.
